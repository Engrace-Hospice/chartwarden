# ChartWarden agent harness (Claude Code + ECC)

This is the evidence pointer for control **CW-CM-02** in `compliance/controls.yaml`. It covers how AI
coding agents work in this repo without touching PHI or secrets and without bypassing change
management, and how that stays cheap.

## Division of labour

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Plan, TDD, code review, react review, security scan, save/resume session | **ECC** (`ecc@ecc`, per-user plugin) |
| Format + `tsc` at Stop | ECC `stop:format-typecheck` |
| Refuse secret paths, PHI-shaped identifiers, credentials, gate bypasses, prod DB access | `scripts/harness/pre-tool-guard.ts` (PreToolUse) |
| Change-scoped architecture gates + PHI scan once per turn | `scripts/harness/stop-gate.ts` (Stop) |
| Metadata-only, hash-chained record of agent actions (local telemetry that catches accidents, not tampering) | `scripts/harness/post-tool-ledger.ts` → `.claude/audit/` |
| PHI/secret scan for humans and CI | `.githooks/pre-commit`, CI `secret-and-phi-scan` (`harness:phi-scan` + gitleaks) |
| HIPAA/SOC 2 claim → evidence register | `compliance/controls.yaml` + `arch:compliance` (in `arch:fitness`) |
| Regulatory review of a diff | `.claude/agents/compliance-reviewer.md` |
| Domain rules, loaded only for matching paths | `.claude/rules/*.md` |
| Codex's twin of the shared harness text (same rules, agent and skills, so a second agent works from the same words) | `.agents/{rules,agents,skills}` + `AGENTS.md`, held identical to `.claude/` + `CLAUDE.md` by `arch:compliance` |

The project's `CLAUDE.md` and gates still win over ECC's generic guidance.

## The Codex twin (`.agents/`, `AGENTS.md`)

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/`; the rest of `.agents/` is a reference copy it follows when
pointed at it. Change `CLAUDE.md` or the shared `.claude/` pieces and make the same change in `AGENTS.md` /
`.agents/` in the same commit: `arch:compliance` fails on any difference, missing file or orphan. It is
the same allow-list in `.gitignore` (plans, prds and local state stay out of git), the same CODEOWNERS
owner, and the same guard coverage (`scripts/harness/patterns.ts` asks before a shell write to
`.agents/{rules,agents,skills}`; `.claude/settings.json` asks before an Edit of `.agents/rules/**`).

`settings.json` is deliberately not mirrored: it is Claude Code's format and Codex does not read it (checked
against Codex 0.162.1: its own config is `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/hooks.json`).

### The Codex guard (`.codex/hooks.json`)

`.codex/hooks.json` runs the same `scripts/harness/pre-tool-guard.ts` for Codex, with `--codex`. It matches
`Bash` and `apply_patch`. Three things differ from Claude Code, all from Codex's hook protocol:

- **Codex cannot ask.** `permissionDecision: "ask"` is "parsed but not supported yet": the hook run is
  marked failed and the tool call proceeds. So under `--codex` every `ask` is answered `deny`, including a
  push, a non-local `ssh` and any write to a protected path. A human runs those, or Claude Code asks.
- **Edits arrive as `apply_patch`**, with the patch text in `tool_input.command`.
  `scripts/harness/codex-patch.ts` takes it apart; every path, rename target and added line is judged as
  Edit/Write are (a rename's destination is scanned without the source file's exemptions). Paths resolve
  from the session directory with symlinks followed, and match case-insensitively (macOS and Windows resolve
  `.Claude/` to `.claude/`). A path with a control or exotic-space character is refused (Codex's Rust trim
  drops U+0085 where JS's does not, so `hooks.json<U+0085>` would otherwise read as another file), as is a
  patch the parser cannot read or one over 256 KB (the scan must finish inside Codex's timeout). Through
  the shell only exactly one `apply_patch <<'EOF' … EOF` is accepted, run in the session directory or the
  call's `workdir`; `cd`, a pipe, a redirect or a second command is refused, because `apply_patch` is on
  PATH and each of those applies a patch the guard cannot place. Codex has no Read/Grep/Glob tools; its reads
  are shell commands. A bare interactive shell or REPL is refused: what is typed into it later reaches it
  through `write_stdin`, which Codex does not hook.
- **The hook command is pinned byte for byte** (`CODEX_GUARD_COMMAND` in
  `scripts/check-compliance-controls.ts`), and each part matters. `bun --config=/dev/null --no-env-file`:
  a `bunfig.toml` `preload` in the session directory would otherwise run before the guard and could silence
  it (`bunfig.toml` is protected for that reason). `perl -e 'alarm 8; exec @ARGV or exit 127'`: Codex runs
  the call when a hook times out (10 s here) and when `exec` fails perl would exit 0, an allow. `|| exit 2`:
  exit 2 with a message blocks in Codex, so a guard that cannot start, crashes or times out blocks the call.
  `perl` and `bun` must be on the hook's PATH; without them every shell call and patch is refused, loudly.
- **The hook layer is a guardrail, not a boundary.** Each developer must trust the hook once (`/hooks`, tied
  to its hash, so a changed hook is skipped until re-trusted) and the project `.codex/` layer must be
  trusted. It can be switched off (`[features] hooks = false`, or a fresh `CODEX_HOME`) or bypassed
  (`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`), and OpenAI calls hooks "a useful guardrail, not a complete
  enforcement boundary". The shell layer is text heuristics, the same as Claude's: it does not understand an
  interpreter script (`python - <<EOF`), `git apply`, `git checkout <rev> -- <protected path>`, a directory
  move or copy, or an obfuscated command name. `write_stdin` and MCP tools are not hooked. **Run Codex in its
  `workspace-write` sandbox: that, not this hook, is the boundary.** Codex has no ledger or Stop gate yet;
  only the guard's own deny entries reach `.claude/audit/`, tagged `codex/<tool>` and capped at 1000
  characters a field.

`.codex/config.toml`, `bunfig.toml`, `AGENTS.override.md` and `.codex/{hooks,rules}/` are on the guard's
protected list at any depth (they are loaded from any directory, and `~/.codex/config.toml` can disable the
hook for a user); `.codex/config.toml` itself stays local and git-ignored. `arch:compliance` fails if
`.codex/hooks.json` is missing or differs from the pinned command, matcher (`Bash|apply_patch`), type or
timeout (1 to 30 s), or if `.gitignore` or CODEOWNERS stop covering it or `bunfig.toml`.

## ECC settings applied by the project (`.claude/settings.json` → `env`)

| Setting | Why |
|---|---|
| `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS=pre:observe:continuous-learning,stop:evaluate-session,stop:desktop-notify` | The observer stores the first 5,000 characters of every tool's **input and output** on disk and feeds them to a background Claude run. In an EHR repo one stray read of a real record would persist it outside our controls. Desktop notifications put response text on the lock screen. |
| `ECC_SKIP_OBSERVE=1` | A second switch for the same observer, read by its shell entry point. |
| `ECC_GOVERNANCE_CAPTURE` (deliberately not set) | Would write detections and approvals to ECC's own state store, outside this repo's retention and review. The repo's ledger and git history are the record instead. |
| `ECC_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=30`, `cleanupPeriodDays: 30` | Session summaries and transcripts are not kept forever. |
| `ECC_SESSION_START_MAX_CHARS=4000` | Halves the context ECC injects at session start (default 8,000). |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` | No telemetry or error reports from sessions in this repo. Side effect: auto-update is off, so update Claude Code deliberately. |

`arch:compliance` fails if the two content-capturing ECC hooks are re-enabled, if the Read denies
are removed, or if the guard or Stop hook is unwired.

## Efficiency

- **One guard process per tool call.** Bun starts in tens of milliseconds, and the guard doesn't shell
  out except for one `git rev-parse` on Bash calls.
- **The Stop gate runs once per response, and usually not at all.** It hashes the changed-file set and
  skips if it matches the last green run. When it does run, it picks only gates whose inputs
  changed. All of them measured under 5 s on the full tree. `arch:tables` (~54 s), `arch:boundaries`
  (~39 s) and `arch:gaps` (~12 s) stay with pre-push and CI.
- **Path-scoped rules.** Only `phi-and-secrets.md` loads every session. Migration, auth/audit and AI
  rules load when matching files are touched.
- **Allow-list for read-only gates.** `bun run arch:*`, `typecheck`, `test`, `lint` and `git
  status/diff/log` run without a permission prompt once the folder is trusted.
- **Avoid ECC's multi-agent loop commands** (CLAUDE.md "Using ECC"). They push every round.

## What needs a human

The harness answers **ask** (you approve or decline) for these:
- edits to `compliance/**`, the harness itself, `.githooks/**`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `.trivyignore.yaml`,
  CI workflows and `deploy/production/**`;
- `git push` (and always for pushes to main), `gh pr merge`, `gh secret`;
- `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync`, raw sockets (`nc`, `socat`, `openssl s_client`), outbound uploads with
  `curl -d/-F/-T`, and requests to a remote host that expand shell values into the URL;
- shell writes to the harness and compliance files above, and setting `CW_STOP_GATE`,
  `CW_AGENT_LEDGER` or `CW_HARNESS_FAIL_OPEN`;
- any live suite (`bun run test:*:live`), with a reminder to use a private container.

It answers **deny** for these:
- reading `.env*` (except `.env.example`), keys, dumps;
- dumping the environment;
- the git hook-skip flag and its abbreviations, `SKIP_FITNESS=1`, re-pointing `core.hooksPath`, and
  `git -c` with hook-disabling keys;
- force-pushing main;
- `psql`/`pg_dump` to a non-local host;
- writing an SSN/MBI-shaped value not in `compliance/synthetic-identifiers.json`, or a credential.

These are guard rails for a cooperative agent, not a sandbox. The authoritative controls remain RLS,
the gates, CI and access control on the servers.

## What the guard covers, and what it cannot

Covered (each has a regression test in `scripts/__tests__/harness-bypasses.test.ts`):
- git global options and abbreviations (`git -C . commit -n`, `-c core.hooksPath=…`);
- command substitution, backticks, subshells, `bash -c`, `eval`, redirections (`cat <.env`) and
  wildcards that expand onto secret files (`cat .e*`, `cat *.env`);
- inline interpreter code that names a secret file (`python -c`, `node -e`, `bun -e`, `perl -e`, `awk`);
- shell writes to the harness itself (`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/audit/`, `scripts/harness/`,
  `compliance/`, `.githooks/`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `CODEOWNERS`), which **ask** because the Edit-tool
  prompt does not see them;
- raw sockets and plain GETs that carry expanded values to a non-local host. "Local" means loopback,
  `host.docker.internal`, or a service named in `docker-compose.yml`; `*.internal` and bare host names
  are **not** local.

**Fails closed.** Empty or unparseable hook input, an internal error, and a write too large to scan
(over 8 MB) all answer `deny`. A human who needs the session back sets `CW_HARNESS_FAIL_OPEN=1` for it.

Cannot cover:
- A program that reads a file through a construct the rules do not anticipate (a script it just wrote,
  `xargs`, `find -exec`, a compiled binary). Shell text is not a security boundary. The real fixes are a
  filesystem sandbox (Claude Code's sandbox read-deny for `.env*`, keys and dumps) or keeping live secret
  files out of the working tree. Until then CW-CM-02 stays `partial`.
- `Grep` with no `glob` over a directory: it relies on ripgrep honouring `.gitignore`, which lists `.env`
  (`arch:compliance` checks that line stays).
- Files the scanners skip as binary: `.pdf`, images, archives and `.pen` design files.
- A guard process that never starts (for example `bun` missing): Claude Code treats that as
  non-blocking. The Stop gate, the pre-commit scan and CI are the lines behind it.
- The Stop gate is advisory after two identical failures (it releases with a notice instead of looping).

## The ledger

`.claude/audit/agent-ledger-YYYY-MM.jsonl` is an unkeyed SHA-256 chain. An accidentally edited, removed
or reordered line breaks it, each month starts from the previous month's last hash, and
`.claude/audit/HEAD` anchors the newest file's line count and hash (`bun run harness:ledger:verify`).
Anyone who can write the directory can rewrite the chain and `HEAD` together, so it is **not**
tamper-proof evidence. If you need that, run `bun run harness:ledger:verify --print-head` and publish the
line somewhere the agent cannot write (a PR comment, a CI artifact).

## Who must review changes to the harness

`.github/CODEOWNERS` names an owner for `.claude/settings.json`, rules, agents, skills, the `.agents/` twins, `.codex/hooks.json`,
`scripts/harness/`, `compliance/`, `.githooks/`, `.gitleaks.toml` and the workflows. It only forces a
review once `main` requires code-owner review (branch protection, open in #16). The CI job runs the PR's
own `phi-scan.ts` and `.gitleaks.toml`, which is why those paths need that review.

## Synthetic identifiers

`compliance/synthetic-identifiers.json` carries a `reviewed` block with a SHA-256 over its `ssn` and
`mbi` lists. `arch:compliance` fails when the lists change without it: a human confirms each new value
is synthetic, then runs `bun run scripts/check-compliance-controls.ts --fingerprint` and records the
result. Prefer never-issued values (SSN area 000, 666, 9xx) in fixtures, which need no listing.

## Setup (once per machine)

```bash
bun install
bun run setup:hooks                 # core.hooksPath -> .githooks (pre-commit + pre-push)
# optional but recommended locally: gitleaks v8.30.1 on PATH
claude                              # trust the folder when asked, so the allow-list takes effect
/plugin list                        # confirm ecc@ecc is enabled
```

Verify that everything works:

```bash
bun run arch:compliance             # register + harness wiring
bun run harness:phi-scan --all      # repo-wide baseline (clean on 2026-10-27)
bunx vitest run scripts/__tests__/harness-*.test.ts scripts/__tests__/compliance-controls.test.ts
bun run harness:ledger:verify       # after a session, the chain is intact
```

## Human overrides

- `CW_STOP_GATE=off claude`: skip the Stop gate for one session (e.g. a docs-only marathon).
- `CW_AGENT_LEDGER=off`: no ledger lines.
- A new synthetic identifier: edit `compliance/synthetic-identifiers.json` and approve the prompt.

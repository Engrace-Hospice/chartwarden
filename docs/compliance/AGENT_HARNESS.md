# ChartWarden agent harness (Claude Code + ECC)

This is the evidence pointer for control **CW-CM-02** in `compliance/controls.yaml`. It covers how AI
coding agents work in this repo without touching PHI or secrets and without bypassing change
management, and how that stays cheap.

## Division of labour

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Plan, TDD, code review, react review, security scan, save/resume session | **ECC** (`ecc@ecc`, per-user plugin) |
| Format + `tsc` at Stop | ECC `stop:format-typecheck` |
| Refuse secret paths, PHI-shaped identifiers, credentials, gate bypasses, prod DB access | `scripts/harness/pre-tool-guard.ts` (PreToolUse) |
| Change-scoped architecture gates + PHI scan once per turn | `scripts/harness/stop-gate.ts` (Stop) |
| Metadata-only, hash-chained record of agent actions | `scripts/harness/post-tool-ledger.ts` → `.claude/audit/` (local) |
| PHI/secret scan for humans and CI | `.githooks/pre-commit`, CI `secret-and-phi-scan` (`harness:phi-scan` + gitleaks) |
| HIPAA/SOC 2 claim → evidence register | `compliance/controls.yaml` + `arch:compliance` (in `arch:fitness`) |
| Regulatory review of a diff | `.claude/agents/compliance-reviewer.md` |
| Domain rules, loaded only for matching paths | `.claude/rules/*.md` |

The project's `CLAUDE.md` and gates still win over ECC's generic guidance.

## ECC settings applied by the project (`.claude/settings.json` → `env`)

| Setting | Why |
|---|---|
| `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS=pre:observe:continuous-learning,stop:evaluate-session,stop:desktop-notify` | The observer stores the first 5,000 characters of every tool's **input and output** on disk and feeds them to a background Claude run. In an EHR repo one stray read of a real record would persist it outside our controls. Desktop notifications put response text on the lock screen. |
| `ECC_SKIP_OBSERVE=1` | A second switch for the same observer, read by its shell entry point. |
| `ECC_GOVERNANCE_CAPTURE=1` | Records secret detections and approval requests in ECC's state store (argument content excluded). This is useful change evidence. |
| `ECC_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=30`, `cleanupPeriodDays: 30` | Session summaries and transcripts are not kept forever. |
| `ECC_SESSION_START_MAX_CHARS=4000` | Halves the context ECC injects at session start (default 8,000). |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` | No telemetry or error reports from sessions in this repo. Side effect: auto-update is off, so update Claude Code deliberately. |

`arch:compliance` fails if the two content-capturing ECC hooks are re-enabled, if the Read denies
are removed, or if the guard or Stop hook is unwired.

## Efficiency

- **One guard process per tool call.** Bun starts in tens of milliseconds, and the guard doesn't shell
  out except for one `git rev-parse` on Bash calls.
- **The Stop gate runs once per response, and usually not at all.** It hashes the changed-file set and
  skips if it matches the last green run. When it does run, it picks only gates whose inputs
  changed. All of them measured under 5 s on the full tree. `arch:tables` (~54 s), `arch:boundaries`
  (~39 s) and `arch:gaps` (~12 s) stay with pre-push and CI.
- **Path-scoped rules.** Only `phi-and-secrets.md` loads every session. Migration, auth/audit and AI
  rules load when matching files are touched.
- **Allow-list for read-only gates.** `bun run arch:*`, `typecheck`, `test`, `lint` and `git
  status/diff/log` run without a permission prompt once the folder is trusted.
- **Avoid ECC's multi-agent loop commands** (CLAUDE.md "Using ECC"). They push every round.

## What needs a human

The harness answers **ask** (you approve or decline) for these:
- edits to `compliance/**`, the harness itself, `.githooks/**`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `.trivyignore.yaml`,
  CI workflows and `deploy/production/**`;
- `git push` (and always for pushes to main), `gh pr merge`, `gh secret`;
- `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync`, outbound uploads with `curl -d/-F/-T`;
- any live suite (`bun run test:*:live`), with a reminder to use a private container.

It answers **deny** for these:
- reading `.env*` (except `.env.example`), keys, dumps;
- dumping the environment;
- `--no-verify`, `SKIP_FITNESS=1`, re-pointing `core.hooksPath`;
- force-pushing main;
- `psql`/`pg_dump` to a non-local host;
- writing an SSN/MBI-shaped value not in `compliance/synthetic-identifiers.json`, or a credential.

These are guard rails for a cooperative agent, not a sandbox. The authoritative controls remain RLS,
the gates, CI and access control on the servers.

## Setup (once per machine)

```bash
bun install
bun run setup:hooks                 # core.hooksPath -> .githooks (pre-commit + pre-push)
# optional but recommended locally: gitleaks v8.30.1 on PATH
claude                              # trust the folder when asked, so the allow-list takes effect
/plugin list                        # confirm ecc@ecc is enabled
```

Verify that everything works:

```bash
bun run arch:compliance             # register + harness wiring
bun run harness:phi-scan --all      # repo-wide baseline (clean on 2026-10-27)
bunx vitest run scripts/__tests__/harness-*.test.ts scripts/__tests__/compliance-controls.test.ts
bun run harness:ledger:verify       # after a session, the chain is intact
```

## Human overrides

- `CW_STOP_GATE=off claude`: skip the Stop gate for one session (e.g. a docs-only marathon).
- `CW_AGENT_LEDGER=off`: no ledger lines.
- A new synthetic identifier: edit `compliance/synthetic-identifiers.json` and approve the prompt.
